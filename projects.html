            CareUI is the brain, skeleton and muscle behind chat and voicebots. It consists of 2 significant areas.
            Statistics and Training. The statistics include the performance of the bots, inputs, outputs, texts,
            ratings and many more. Furthermore, to the current point, this area also includes the statistics of the
            FAQ section of the website.</br></br>

            Statistics about content performance are crucial for companies because they provide valuable insights
            into how their content is resonating with their target audience. By analyzing metrics such as page
            views, engagement rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates, companies can determine what types
            of content are driving traffic and ultimately leading to conversions.</br></br>

            This information is especially important for companies that rely on content marketing as a primary
            strategy for driving leads and sales. By identifying what types of content are most effective at
            engaging and converting their audience, they can focus their efforts on creating more of this content
            and refining their overall content strategy.</br></br>

            In addition, content performance statistics can help companies identify areas where their content is
            falling short. By analyzing metrics such as bounce rates and exit rates, they can determine where
            visitors are dropping off and make adjustments to improve the user experience and keep visitors on their
            site longer.</br></br>

            The training includes entering answers to specific questions, creating chat flows and formatting texts.
            This includes the training for the voicebots as well as the training for the chatbots. The training of
            these is very important for several aspects.

            Training chatbots is crucial for improving customer experience in today's digital age. As more and more
            businesses move online, customers expect quick and efficient service at any time of the day or night.
            Chatbots are an increasingly popular way to meet this demand, as they can provide 24/7 support without
            the need for human agents.</br></br>

            However, a poorly trained chatbot can be frustrating for customers and may even drive them away from a
            business. This is why it's important to invest in the training of chatbots to ensure that they can
            provide helpful and accurate responses to customers' queries.</br></br>

            By using machine learning algorithms, chatbots can be trained to understand the nuances of natural
            language and to recognize different types of customer requests. This enables them to provide more
            personalized responses and to resolve issues more quickly.</br></br>

            Additionally, well-trained chatbots can help to reduce the workload of human agents, freeing them up to
            focus on more complex tasks. This can lead to improved job satisfaction for agents and a better overall
            customer experience.

            When designing the tool, we worked completely independently from the company's UX department. The basic
            functions were created by me and a senior UX designer at the beginning. Gradually, I took on the leading
            role and, with the help of another dual student, completely took over the innovation work and the design of
            new features. Later, the UX and UI design was completely handed over to us UX design students.Through the
            constant exchange and repetitive feedback process, we were able to build a self-driving improvement process
            in collaboration with product owners, stakeholders of the individual countries and the development team,
            thus building an enormously helpful and productive platform for the company, which in the long run will
            become a central tool for the company to promote customer satisfaction.</br></br>

            After 2.5 years, however, I temporarily handed over the product to my colleagues and another dual student
            for UX design, as I received requests for support for a new project in which the training tool was to be
            redesigned and I was to be completely responsible for the design and creation of new use cases and features.
            I also accepted this in order to gain more experience in other areas as well. However, I was still available
            for my colleagues at CareUI and Chatbot in an advisory role.</br></br>
